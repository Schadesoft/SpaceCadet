<p>Astrometrics Mission: Level 2</p>
<p>Objective: The player&apos;s ship has detected a strange asteroid field in a nearby star system. The asteroids appear to be composed of a rare and valuable mineral, but the field is also surrounded by dangerous radiation. The player must investigate and determine if it is safe to mine the asteroids.</p>

<p>Possible Solutions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The asteroids are safe to mine, the player can begin mining the dilithium crystals</li>
    <li>The radiation levels are too dangerous, the player must retreat and find another source of dilithium.</li>
    <li>The player can use a radiation shielding technology and safely mine the asteroids.</li>
    <li>The asteroids are unstable and may explode, the player must destroy the asteroids and retreat.</li>
</ol>
<p>*Correct Answer: 2) The radiation levels are too dangerous, the player must retreat and find another source of dilithium. The Radiation level of 1000 mSv/hr is incredibly dangerous and not safe for human exposure, thus it&apos;s impossible to mine the asteroids safely.</p>
